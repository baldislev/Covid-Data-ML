# Covid-Data-ML
> ML techniques on a synthetic medical data for covid related risks prediction.

## Data:
> It is a synthetic data provided by the university for experimenting with ML techniques.
> Data mimics patient's info as well as medical stats such as PCR results for covid characteristics prediction.

## covid_data_exploration.ipynb
> Here most of the data exploration and preprocessing actions were conducted.

## covid_data_learning_1.ipynb
> In this part custom KNN and Soft SVM was implemented and tested as well as the scikit-learn's Decision Tree Classifier.

## covid_data_learning_1.ipynb
> Linear Regression implementation and testing as well as applying L2, L1 Regularizations and Polynomial Data Fit.

All models were tuned with Cross Validation.
